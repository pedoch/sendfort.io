### Code contribution guidelines

#### Branching model

- Feature branches should be prefixed with `feat/`.
- Bugfix branches should be prefixed with `bug/`.
- Documentation branches should be prefixed with `doc/`
- Build/test branches should be prefixed with `mnt/`
- After the prefix include a short description of what your branch is dedicated for. For example: `bug/fix-everything-that-was-broken`.
- If there's an issue filed that your branch is addressing, include the issue number directly after the prefix. For example: `bug/1234-fix-all-the-other-things`.

#### Committing

- Break your commits into logical atomic units. Well-segmented commits make it much easier for others to step through your changes.
- Limit your subject line to 69 characters as GitHub will truncates subjects more than 70 characters.
- Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't use GitHub's magic words in your commits to close issues - do that in the pull request body instead.

Read [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guide before creating your first commit.

#### Making pull requests

- Summarize your changes in the PR body. When in doubt, write a list things .
- Include references to issues that your PR solves, and use GitHub's magic words to close the issues automatically when your PR is merged. Please add the references in the PR body and not the title.
- Include tests that cover new or changed functionality.
